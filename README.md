# LazyInstagram

This project is intended to be the best Instagram bot on the market. It boasts some unique features such as AI image recognition, and zero-configuration photo/user scraping rules.

It currently relies on the Instagram API, and it currently violates the Instagram API, so it will never get approved for production use. The next big milestone will be to rewrite the instagram functionality so it works with a headless browser, such as PhantomJS, instead of the API.
